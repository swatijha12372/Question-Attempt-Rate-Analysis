# 📊 School Exam Question Attempt Rate Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **question-wise attempt rates** of students in a school exam using **statistical methods**.  
The goal is to identify the **difficulty level of questions** based on how many students attempted them.

This is a **Statistics Minor Semester Project**, implemented using **Python in Jupyter Notebook**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To calculate **question-wise attempt rate (%)**
- To perform **mean analysis**
- To visualize data using **box plots and bar charts**
- To classify questions into **Easy, Medium, and Hard**
- To help teachers improve **question paper quality**

---

## 🗂 Dataset Description
- Rows represent **students**
- Columns represent **questions (Q1, Q2, …)**
- Values:
  - `1` → Question attempted
  - `0` → Question not attempted

Example:
| Student | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 |
|--------|----|----|----|
| S1     | 1  | 1  | 0  |
| S2     | 1  | 0  | 1  |

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas** – data handling
- **NumPy** – numerical calculations
- **Matplotlib** – data visualization

---

## 📐 Methodology
1. Count total number of students
2. Calculate **attempt count** for each question
3. Compute **attempt rate percentage**
4. Calculate **mean attempt rate**
5. Plot **box plot** and **bar chart**
6. Classify difficulty level:
- ≥ 70% → Easy
- 40–69% → Medium
- < 40% → Hard

---

## 📊 Visualizations
- **Bar Chart**: Question-wise attempt rate
- **Box Plot**: Distribution of attempt rates

These visualizations help understand variation and difficulty patterns.

---

## ✅ Results & Conclusion
- High attempt rate → Easy questions
- Low attempt rate → Difficult questions
- Mean and box plot provide overall statistical insight
- Useful for exam analysis and academic improvement
